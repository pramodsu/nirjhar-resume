# Introduction

This repository contains the resume for the upcoming interviews and placements.

## Compiling

Use the makefile.

    $ make

If all goes well, the above will produce main.pdf.

If you are editing and compiling repeatedly, you may want to run the script compile_loop.sh. The script monitors directory activity and recompiles whenever a file is changed.
